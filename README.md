# Proyect-vending-machine
It is a vending machine with its own graphic interface using Java Swing, the whole thing is written in Java.

The catch is, the ENTER or the selling button doesn't work, it has to show the remaining of the sell and it has to update the money screen, than it clears the other displays 

Note
- It would be nice to add a give-my-money button in order to clear and return all the money inserted by the user.
